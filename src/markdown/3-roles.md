# treasure

## rarity

Each item in this game is classified by its rarity — a measure of how special the item is. Use an item's rarity to consider whether it's an appropriate reward for a situation in the story.

<span class="keywords">uncommon</span>. These items are more valuable and curious than the common goods seen by most people. Consider offering uncommon items as rewards for minor encounters, like defeating a band of minions, or as curiosities traded in the back room of a special store.

Feel free to offer one or more uncommon items each play session.

<span class="keywords">rare</span>. These are exceptional items of great value that are very difficult to find and often well-guarded. Offer a rare item as a reward for a difficult series of challenges.

It's good to give a rare item to the party once every 2-3 play sessions.

<span class="keywords">legendary</span>. These are priceless and often unique items of great power, only found in the most remote or guarded places. They are extraordinarily difficult to acquire, and the owners of legendary items will often go to great lengths to protect them.

Offer a legendary item when the players complete a major story arc, or about once every 7-10 play sessions.

<span class="keywords">supreme</span>. These are items of such incredible power that the consequences of their use ripple through the omniverse. Guides should only grant these items if they want a supreme item's unique features to dramatically change the story.

## symbols

&lt;x&gt; This is how much damage an item deals when used to attack.
